Hi, my name is Caleb, also known as techyporcupine! I am a HS student who enjoys spending my time playing with technology. 

I enjoy many aspects of messing around with tech and having fun. Specifically, some categories that I particularly enjoy are network engineering (thanks for making it not too expensive, Ubiquiti!) and enjoying messing around with Linux (specifically NixOS)!

I'm open to tips on how to improve this site whenever, you can contact me via the email on my Github profile!

(Almost) all of my publicly exposed sites are dual-stacked with IPv6 thanks to Hurricane Electric or Cloudflare, as my ISP does not support IPv6, and I even have a cert to show it!
